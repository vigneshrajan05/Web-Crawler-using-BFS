Web 
crawlers automatically browse or grab information from the Internet according to specified rules. Be 
it in the field of natural language understanding or data analytics, scraping data from websites 
through crawling web pages is one of the main aspects of many such applications. 
In this project, a web crawler has been developed to run on a movie website [BoxOfficeMojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/) where in a few years 
will be picked to crawl through the top ‘n’ movies in each year and display the details about the 
movies. We've made use of Breadth First Search(BFS) for crawling through links.
